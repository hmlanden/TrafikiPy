# Project Details
## Data Sources:
- Accident Data: https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/dataPopulation 
- Weather: OpenWeatherMap API

## Libraries:
- Pandas 
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib
- geoplotlib
- Numpy
- scikit-learn
- OS

## Data Cleaning: Charles!

## Statistics
For all stats questions, we will say results are statistically significant at:
- 95% Confidence Interval / P-Value < 0.5

## Questions:
1. Correlation between weather and severity/casualties? (Pratham)
2. Correlation between time of day and accidents? (Dolly)
3. More/less casualties based on road type (taking into account urban vs rural)? (Dolly)
4. Correlation between accident COUNT and day of the week? (Heidi)

## Features:
- Basic visualizations
    - map viz
- Create a predictive model using Naive Bayes relating weather conditions and likelihood of accident.
    - Predict likelihood of getting into an accident based on weather conditions
